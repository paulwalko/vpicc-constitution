when their dues are paid.</li>
<li>Any full members may choose associate membership. Full membership
may be reinstated upon written notification of the club treasurer during
the first two meetings of any subsequent semester.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Associate membership shall be reserved for those who have completed
requirements for full membership but are not students, faculty or staff
of VPI&amp;SU. Associate members have all privileges of full membership
except for the holding of an elected office and voting. Full and
associate members shall have access to club records and files and may

emergency a special election will take place at the next regular meeting

of the club, and the state of emergency will extend until it is voted
upon at that said meeting. During a state of emergency the following
policies will go into effect:
<ol type="A">
<li>Any full, student member may hold office regardless of part-time or
full-time status.</li>
<li>In the event that there are not enough willing student members to
hold office, the club may elect non-student associate and full members,
as defined in Article III, Section 1.b to take on the responsibilities
of the Vice President and/or Secretary as acting officers</li>
<li>A state of emergency has no effect on a member’s voting status,
except,</li>
<li>In the event that fewer than 3 members are eligible to vote,
associate members will be allowed to vote to approve new members.</li>
<li>During a state of emergency the items herein supersede any and all
conflicting bylaws or directives</li>

votes from full membership.</li>
